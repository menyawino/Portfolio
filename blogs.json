There is even more story to it as computational biologists started to internalize their own good practices in their scripts and software based on their experience with biological data.</p>\n<p>As a bioinformatician coming from the biology background side, I wish I had known some things earlier on so that I could possibly write better code that I am currently too lazy to update, or ones that I already submitted somewhere and possibly got me a bad impression. To do that, I should have invested in understanding Python <em>down to the metal</em>. Here are 4 tips that could save you time, memory, or\u00a0both:</p>\n<h3>1. Memory Management: Why NumPy Isn\u2019t as Simple as It\u00a0Looks</h3>\n<p>Ever used np.empty() to initialize a NumPy array? If you thought it was like np.zeros() but faster, you\u2019re in for a surprise. np.empty() doesn\u2019t zero out memory. Instead, it grabs a chunk of memory and leaves whatever garbage data was already\u00a0there.</p>\n<h4>Why This\u00a0Matters</h4>\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re analyzing a massive genomic dataset\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe 1 billion rows of SNPs. You\u2019re trying to save time, so you use np.empty() for preallocation. Here\u2019s the kicker: until you explicitly overwrite every cell, your array contains <em>whatever random data was in memory</em>. That could lead to errors or garbage\u00a0results.</p>\n<h4>A Pro\u00a0Move</h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re working with sensitive data (e.g., patient genomes), always sanitize your arrays with np.zeros() unless performance is critical and you <strong>know what you\u2019re\u00a0doing</strong>.</p>\n<h3>2. Parsing Genomic Files: FASTQ, BAM, and Why File I/O Is Slower Than You\u00a0Think</h3>\n<p>When was the last time you thought about <em>how</em> Python reads files? Most people just\u00a0do:</p>\n<pre>with open('file.fastq', 'r') as f:<br>    for line in f:<br>        process(line)</pre>\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing: this approach is a snail when you\u2019re handling gigabyte-scale files. Every time Python reads a chunk, it performs a system call, which adds overhead.</p>\n<h4>What\u2019s the\u00a0Fix?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Use rb mode (open('file.fastq', 'rb')). It skips unnecessary encoding/decoding.</li>\n<li>Batch your reads. Try something like:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>with open('file.fastq', 'rb') as f:<br>    chunk = f.read(1024 * 1024)  # 1 MB at a time<br>    process(chunk)</pre>\n<p>For BAM files, libraries like pysam are lifesavers because they understand the BGZF compression. They don\u2019t just read BAM\u2014they <em>map memory to it</em>, which makes fetching individual alignments way\u00a0faster.</p>\n<h4>Real Bioinformatics Use\u00a0Case</h4>\n<p>Processing BAM files for structural variant detection is slow if you\u2019re iterating through reads one by one. With pysam, you can fetch reads overlapping a specific region in a\u00a0snap:</p>\n<pre>import pysam<br>bam = pysam.AlignmentFile(\"sample.bam\", \"rb\")<br>for read in bam.fetch(\"chr1\", 100000, 200000):<br>    process(read)</pre>\n<p>This is why pysam is the backbone of tools like\u00a0GATK.</p>\n<h3>3. GIL Isn\u2019t Your Enemy (If You Know What You\u2019re\u00a0Doing)</h3>\n<p>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is Python\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel for multi-threading. But let\u2019s be honest: in bioinformatics, we rarely need threads. What we need is <strong>multiprocessing</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aindependent processes that work on different chunks of the\u00a0data.</p>\n<h4>A Practical Tip</h4>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re aligning sequences in parallel. Use multiprocessing.Pool to distribute work:</p>\n<pre>from multiprocessing import Pool</pre>\n<pre>def align(sequence):<br>    # Do alignment<br>    return result</pre>\n<pre>with Pool(8) as p:  # 8 processes<br>    results = p.map(align, sequences)</pre>\n<p>This works beautifully because each process has its own memory space, bypassing the GIL entirely.</p>\n<h4>When It\u00a0Fails</h4>\n<p>If you need shared memory (like for genomic indexes), look into multiprocessing.shared_memory. It lets processes communicate without duplicating data.</p>\n<h3>4. Profiling: The Tool You\u2019re Probably\u00a0Ignoring</h3>\n<p>You think your Python script is slow, but do you know <em>why</em>? That\u2019s where profiling tools like cProfile and line_profiler come\u00a0in.</p>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>You\u2019re parsing a FASTQ file and notice your script is taking forever. Profile\u00a0it:</p>\n<pre>@profile<br>def parse_fastq(file):<br>    for line in open(file):<br>        process(line)  # Is this the bottleneck?</pre>\n<p>line_profiler might show that the process() function is your problem. Instead of processing line-by-line, you could batch-process 1,000 lines at a time. Boom\u2014instant speedup.</p>\n<h3>The Bottom\u00a0Line</h3>\n<p>Python is a high-level language, but if you dig into its internals, you can unlock big performance improvements for bioinformatics workflows\u00a0:)</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=914fcc736bd2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*E9-rXll3xoSYC3zbk8MCsw.jpeg\"></figure><p>So, your friend says he\u2019s a capable bioinformatician?
